**C Programming Repository**

**📌 Overview**

This repository contains a curated collection of C programs, ordered from basic concepts to more advanced data structures and algorithms.
It is designed to help learners build a strong foundation and gradually move towards solving complex problems.

**🛠️ Technologies Used**

Language: C

Compiler: GCC / MinGW / Code::Blocks / Visual Studio Code

Libraries: Standard C libraries (stdio.h, stdlib.h, string.h)

**🗂️ Program Categories (Ordered by Complexity)**

**🔹 1. Basic Programs**

Program	Description : 

hello.c	=> Simple "Hello, World!" program.

hi.c	=> Basic test program (similar to "Hello, World").

**🚀 How to Run the Programs**

Clone or download the repository.

Open any .c file in your preferred editor.

Compile and run using a C compiler.

Example:

	gcc filename.c -o output
	./output
Replace filename.c with the program you want to run.

**📈 Future Improvements**

Implement tree data structures (Binary Trees, AVL Trees)

Add file-handling programs

Build mini-projects like Library Management System, Student Record System, etc.

**📚 Acknowledgements**

Programs created for strengthening fundamental programming knowledge.
